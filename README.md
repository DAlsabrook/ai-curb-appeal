# Ai Curb Appeal Project
Operating on a subscription model, the site helps homeowners and property owners save money on costly design changes by visualizing updates before committing. The project has been a rewarding challenge so far as my first major venture with Next.js. From integrating multiple AI APIs and managing NoSQL databases to handling Stripe payments, it has pushed me to learn new technologies and how to interconnect them to all work together.

Users can upload images of their home to train a custom AI model based on their unique property. With text prompts, they can then explore design possibilities—changing colors, materials, structures, and even the landscaping—creating a personalized vision for their home.

After securely logging in, users gain access to a dashboard where they have complete control over their model options. They can select which model to run, enter text prompts to adjust the image, set "negative" prompts to specify elements to avoid, and control how closely the model adheres to the original images it was trained on.

Once a model is chosen and a prompt is provided, the system generates four images based on the user's input. These images are sent to our database, and the dashboard is automatically updated with the results once they’re processed and returned by the model.
